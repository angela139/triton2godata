# triton2godata
### This is a fun project to analyze data from the Triton2Go app (UCSD dining hall app) and create a parody of Spotify Wrapped with interesting findings from the data. I intend to upload the code that was used to capture data and analyze it once I have organized it. I definetely wrote the code with impulse and can barely understand what has happened either. If you want a small look at the chaos, please look at the following [webpage](https://angela139.github.io/triton2godata/ucsd_dining.html). 

#### Also, here's the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p3MmpSSyI5vu032Pkw-s8U1mcKZDKB_OoGCnik3oXtk/edit?usp=sharing) I made with the data.
